In this you will find (CREATREON)folder this is-> the home page react app which doesnt have javasript attached and the others pages attached to it. it also have login page but not connected with it .
In the (Creatreon other pages Html,css )file you will get the code for the other pages but they don't have the headder and footer connected with them.
In (rough.html)file you will get javascript code for the home page especially like for vedio loop over there in the main page
